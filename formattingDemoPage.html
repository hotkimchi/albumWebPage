    <h1>Formatting Demo Page</h1>
    <p>
      This simple page demonstrates the formating tags covered in this lesson.
    </p>
    <h2>Bold and Strong</h2>
    <div>
      <b>This is bold text</b>
      <p>
        The Strong tag has the same visual effect as the bold tag but the strong tag also marks the enclosed text as important.
        It is also easier for screen readers to read.
      </p>
      <strong>This is what Strong text looks like</strong>
    </div>
    <h2>Italics and Emphasis</h2>
    <div>
      <i>This text is in itlaics</i>
      <p>
        The emphasis tag has the same visual effect as the italic tag but the tag also marks the enclosed text as more important.
        It is also easier for screen readers to read.
      </p>
      <em>This is what emphasized text looks like</em>
    </div>
    <h2>Subscript and Superscript</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Subscript text looks like this <sub>This is subscript.</sub>
      </p>
      <p>
        Superscrit text looks like this <sup>This is superscript.</sup>
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Inserted and Deleted</h2>
